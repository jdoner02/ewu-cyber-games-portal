if (!showUnfinishedGames) {
  gamesToShow = gamesToShow.filter(game => game.isFinished)
}

// UI Toggle Component
<motion.button
  onClick={() => setShowUnfinishedGames(!showUnfinishedGames)}
  className={showUnfinishedGames ? 'active' : 'inactive'}
>
  {showUnfinishedGames ? 'Hide Unfinished Games' : 'Show Unfinished Games'}
</motion.button>
