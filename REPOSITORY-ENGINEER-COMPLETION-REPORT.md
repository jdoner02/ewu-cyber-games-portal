# 1. Remove unused imports
# 2. Fix React Hook dependencies  
# 3. Escape HTML entities in educational content
# 4. Replace 'any' types with specific TypeScript types
```

### **Headers Warning (Expected)**
The warning about headers not working with static export is expected and acceptable:
- Security headers are configured correctly
- GitHub Pages doesn't support dynamic headers
- Alternative: Configure headers at CDN/proxy level if needed
