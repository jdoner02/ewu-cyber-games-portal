**Date:** July 17, 2025  
**Agent:** Command Architect  
**Objective:** Clean up EWU Cyber Games repository for optimal student experience (ages 10-14)

## ✅ Cleanup Actions Completed

### 🧹 Administrative File Organization
- **Moved completion reports** to `.dev-docs/`: `EDUCATIONAL-ENHANCEMENT-COMPLETE.md`
- **Cleaned development files**: Moved `dev-server.sh`, `monitor.js`, `monitor.py` to `.dev-docs/`
- **Removed clutter**: Deleted old backup folder `src_backup_20250716_002719/`
- **Result**: Main directory now shows only student-relevant content

### 🎯 Language Improvements
- **Replaced "addictive" terminology** with educational alternatives:
  - `src/app/games/cyber-clicker/page.tsx`: "addictive" → "engaging...that builds real skills"
  - `src/app/page.tsx`: "addictive" → "compelling...that teaches real skills"
- **Maintained professional, parent-approved language** throughout

### 📚 Enhanced Student Experience
- **Created `WELCOME-STUDENTS.md`**: Accessible entry point for 10-14 year olds
  - Growth mindset messaging
  - Clear learning progression (Explorer → Detective → Architect)
  - Confidence-building language
  - Safe exploration assurances
- **Updated main README**: Added prominent link to student welcome guide

## 🧠 Pedagogical Principles Applied

### Research-Backed Approach
