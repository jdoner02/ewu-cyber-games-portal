## 🛠️ Technical Implementation (For Code Explorers)

### 📊 Password Strength Calculation
```typescript
// How we calculate password strength (simplified for learning)
function calculatePasswordStrength(password: string): number {
  let strength = 0
  
  // Length matters most!
  strength += password.length * 4
  
  // Character variety adds strength
  if (/[a-z]/.test(password)) strength += 2  // lowercase
  if (/[A-Z]/.test(password)) strength += 2  // uppercase  
  if (/[0-9]/.test(password)) strength += 2  // numbers
  if (/[^A-Za-z0-9]/.test(password)) strength += 3  // symbols
  
  // Penalty for common patterns
  if (isCommonWord(password)) strength -= 10
  if (hasKeyboardPattern(password)) strength -= 5
  
  return Math.max(0, Math.min(100, strength))
}
```

### 🎮 Game State Management
```typescript
// What the game remembers between sessions
interface PasswordFortressState {
  // Current password being built
  currentPassword: string
  
  // Player progress
  totalClicks: number
  securityPoints: number
  
  // Upgrades purchased
  upgrades: {
    autoLength: number        // Automatically adds characters
    smartSymbols: number      // Adds good special characters
    dictionaryBlocker: number // Replaces weak words
    entropyBooster: number    // Increases randomness
  }
  
  // Achievements unlocked
  achievements: string[]
  
  // Statistics for learning
  stats: {
    strongestPassword: string
    totalPasswordsCreated: number
    hackersDefeated: number
  }
}
```

### 🔄 Auto-Generation System
```typescript
// How the game generates stronger passwords automatically
function autoGenerateImprovement(state: PasswordFortressState): string {
  let improved = state.currentPassword
  
  // Auto-length upgrade: add random characters
  if (state.upgrades.autoLength > 0) {
    improved += generateRandomChar()
  }
  
  // Smart symbols: replace weak characters with strong ones
  if (state.upgrades.smartSymbols > 0) {
    improved = addSmartSymbols(improved)
  }
  
  // Dictionary blocker: replace common words
  if (state.upgrades.dictionaryBlocker > 0) {
    improved = replaceCommonWords(improved)
  }
  
  return improved
}
```

## 📚 Educational Integration

### 💡 Learning Tooltips
Hover over any element to learn:
- **Password length**: "Each character makes your password 95x harder to crack!"
