# Pokemon Cyber MMO Fix Report
**Date:** July 17, 2025  
**Issue:** Pokemon Cyber MMO game not loading at https://jdoner02.github.io/ewu-cyber-games-portal/games/pokemon-cyber-mmo/

## Problem Analysis
The game was experiencing a client-side rendering bailout in Next.js static export. Investigation revealed several issues:

1. **Missing Default Export**: The `PokemonCyberMMO.tsx` component was not properly exported
2. **Conflicting Metadata Import**: The page.tsx had `import { Metadata } from 'next'` in a client component
3. **Path Resolution Issues**: The dynamic import was using `@/` alias which wasn't resolving correctly in static export

## Technical Investigation
- Checked live site: Loading state persisted indefinitely 
- Examined build output: Route was being built (1.58 kB) but component failing to load
- Found HTML template: `<template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template>`
- Identified root cause: Dynamic import failure due to missing export and path issues

## Solution Implemented
1. **Added Missing Export** to `/src/games/pokemon-cyber-mmo/PokemonCyberMMO.tsx`:
   ```tsx
   export default PokemonCyberMMO;
   ```

2. **Fixed Dynamic Import Path** in `/src/app/games/pokemon-cyber-mmo/page.tsx`:
   ```tsx
   // Before:
   () => import('@/games/pokemon-cyber-mmo/PokemonCyberMMO')
   
   // After:
   () => import('../../../games/pokemon-cyber-mmo/PokemonCyberMMO')
   ```

3. **Removed Conflicting Import**:
   ```tsx
   // Removed: import { Metadata } from 'next'
   // (Metadata can't be used in client components)
   ```

## Verification
- ✅ Build completed successfully 
- ✅ Pokemon Cyber MMO route shows in build output (1.59 kB)
- ✅ Static files generated correctly in `/out/games/pokemon-cyber-mmo/`
- ✅ Changes committed and pushed to production

## Expected Results
After GitHub Pages deployment (~5-10 minutes), the Pokemon Cyber MMO game should:
- Load properly at the URL
- Display the full game interface instead of stuck loading screen
- Provide access to all educational cybersecurity content for students

## Educational Impact
This fix restores access to comprehensive GenCyber camp content including:
- Day 1-5 cybersecurity tutorials
- Algorithm learning systems
- CTF competition tutorials
- Knowledge arena challenges
- Interactive Pokemon-themed cybersecurity education
